Muslims believe in the divinity of Allah and Muhammad (PBUH) to be His last messenger. 
The importance of being the last messenger is great. 
There would not come any other prophet after him as Islam has been completed under his guidance.<br>

Muslims believe that Muhammad (PBUH) has completed the message from Allah and this message would exist forever. 
Allah has taken the responsibility of the Quran which is the Holy Book of Muslims in order to provide its safety 
and security. <br>
This book has been written and compiled under Muhammad (PBUH) through Allah’s guidance. 
Not even a single word of the Quran has been modified against the will of Allah. 
This makes it such and important book which contains the complete message from Allah.<br>


Seerat Un Nabi (PBUH) is known as the acts of the Prophet according to the teachings of Islam. <br>

It contains the history, events, wars, prayers and sayings of the last messenger of Allah. 
It has been narrated by Hazrat Ayesha (RA) that the character of the Messenger of Allah is the Quran. 
He was the walking Quran which means that his every action was according to the teachings of the Quran. 
If one has to follow the footsteps of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), 
he needs to first read and understand Quran.<br>


The biographers and historians differed concerning the day and month of the birth of the Prophet.  
The strongest opinion concerning the birth of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is that he 
was born in the twelfth of Rabee‘ al-Awwal in the Year of the Elephant.  
The most well-known view is that the death of the Prophet occurred on 12th Rabee‘ al-Awwal 11 AH.<br>

The biographers and historians differed concerning the day and month of the birth of the Prophet (blessings and peace of 
Allah be upon him). This is something for which there is good reason, as it was not known what status this newborn would 
achieve; his situation was like that of any other newborn. Hence no one can state with certainty the date of his birth 
(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). <br>
<br><br><br>
Dr. Muhammad at-Tayyib an-Najjar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: <br><br><br><br>

“Perhaps the reason for this difference of opinion is that when he was born, no one expected that he would attend such a 
status. For that reason, he did not live in the spotlight from the beginning of his life. When Allah decreed that the 
Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) should begin to convey His message forty years after he was born, 
people began to seek out whatever memories they had about this Prophet, and they asked one another about every detail of
his life. They were helped in that by what the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) himself narrated 
about incidents that he had experienced from his birth, as well as the reports narrated by his Companions and those who 
had also gone through those events with him. 
<br>
At that time the Muslims began to collect everything that they had heard about the life story of their Prophet 
(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in order to transmit it to the people down throughout the ages.”
