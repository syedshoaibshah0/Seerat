 Hazrat Khadija, the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), was renowned for her exceptional character, 
 intelligence, and unwavering support for the early Islamic community. As a successful and respected businesswoman, 
 she played a vital role in the life of the Prophet, offering him comfort, guidance, and encouragement during the 
 initial years of his prophethood. Khadija's steadfast belief in the message of Islam and her unyielding dedication 
 to the principles of justice and compassion made her a revered figure among the early Muslims. Her role as a devoted 
 companion and confidante to the Prophet not only underscored the importance of women in early Islamic society but also
